This Power BI dashboard shows key insights from eCommerce sales data. It includes top states by sales, top customers, and profit trends by category, sub-category, and month. The dashboard helps users understand which products and regions are performing best and where profits are coming from.

You can filter the data by month, category, sub-category, and state to explore trends in more detail. The dashboard is built using Power BI with Power Query for data cleaning and DAX for calculations.
